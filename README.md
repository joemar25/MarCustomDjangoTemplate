You may use this Custom-Django Template I made, which is simplified, and I found efficient when handling you're own API's.

all goods as initial & has admin (currently hidden)

to use the template:
1. you need a database inside:
application/_core/database/["db.sqlite3]
2. you need to have `.env` just outside the application folder
where it should contains:
APP_NAME=app_name
SECRET_KEY=secret_key
ALLOWED_HOSTS=str localhost 127.0.0.1
DEBUG=True or False
DATABASE_URL=""
