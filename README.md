Deploying with correct static files (dev vs. prod)
    static files on deployment is not recommended, ineffecient, and not secure
    for storage i will not digital ocean cloud service since it is not free
    i try the dropbox atleast i have 2gb free storage
    for security this project is good since it hides the private static to a public place safely
    without compromising the application

using dropbox
